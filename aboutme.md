## About Me
---
- I am motivational, regular and **dedicated to goals I have to achieve**. 
- I received the **B.S degrees**, in French language & literature from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India, in 2018.  
- I am intersted in Deep Learning, Convolutional Nerual Network, **Object Detection** , **Real-Time Object Detection**.  
- Later, I would like to study on **Unsupervised anomaly detection**, detecting abnormal events based on unsupervised learning and on **Optimizing a trade-off** between accuracy and inference speed of Object Detection models.  
- **Currently**, I have been working on personal AI project including toy project and on reading papers regarding Object Detection.
